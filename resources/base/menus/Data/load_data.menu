<p>Load data from file and put this data in given matrix.</p>
Valid options for `load' are listed in the following list:<br>
<br>
    `-force'<br>
          The `-force' option is accepted but ignored for backward
          compatiability. Octave now overwrites variables currently in
          memory with the same name as those found in the file.
<br>
    `-ascii'<br>
          Force Octave to assume the file contains columns of numbers
          in text format without any header or other information.  Data
          in the file will be loaded as a single numeric matrix with
          the name of the variable derived from the name of the file.
<br>
    `-binary'<br>
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's binary format.
<br>
    `-mat'
    `-mat-binary'
    `-6'
    `-v6'
    `-7'
    `-v7'<br>
          Force Octave to assume the file is in MATLAB's version 6 or 7
          binary format.
<br>
    `-V4'
    `-v4'
    `-4'
    `-mat4-binary'<br>
          Force Octave to assume the file is in the binary format
          written by MATLAB version 4.
<br>
    `-hdf5'<br>
          Force Octave to assume the file is in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is
          a free, portable binary format developed by the National
          Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of
          Illinois.)  Note that Octave can read HDF5 files not created
          by itself, but may skip some datasets in formats that it
          cannot support.<br>

          HDF5 load and save are not available, as this Octave
          executable was not linked with the HDF5 library.
<br>
    `-import'<br>
          The `-import' is accepted but ignored for backward
          compatiability.  Octave can now support multi-dimensional HDF
          data and automatically modifies variable names if they are
          invalid Octave identifiers.
<br>
    `-text'<br>
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's text format.
